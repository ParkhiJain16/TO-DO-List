# TO-DO-List
A simple yet powerful To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows you to add main tasks with sub-tasks, mark tasks as completed, and manage your daily goals efficiently through an interactive and minimal UI.

Features:-

➕ Add Heading Tasks: Create a main task or project category (e.g., “Work”, “Groceries”, “Assignments”).

📝 Add Sub-Tasks: Add multiple sub-tasks under each heading to break down your work into smaller actionable items.

✅ Mark Tasks as Complete: Click or check off a task once it’s done — the task will be visually struck through or styled differently.

❌ Remove Tasks: Delete unwanted tasks or sub-tasks easily.

💾 (Optional) Save your list in local storage (if implemented) so tasks remain after reloading.

💡 Clean, responsive, and beginner-friendly code structure.

How It Works:-

1) Enter a main heading/task name (e.g., “Study Schedule”).

2) Add sub-tasks under it (e.g., “Complete Math homework”, “Revise notes”).

3) When a sub-task is completed, simply click or check it to mark it as done.

4) Tasks are organized neatly in a tabular or list layout for clarity.
